# JS-Bookmarking-App
 
Video ONe  Floating Inptus- i coded along and have a couple questions about the function used to showFloater.
1. we selected the body of the document . but where is classList coming from ?

Video 2 Showing bookmarks with JS-
Here we creaeted a bookmark form and then changed the button type on the button to submit. created a book mark list and content class div.
Then we created some JS variables for bookmarkslist from grabbing the class bookmarks-list in the html and then did the same for bookmarkForm. From the bookmark form we grabbed its input and then created another variable called bookmarkInput. We took the input's value to create another variable then bassed that into bookmark.  we used appendchild to addinto the bookmarkslist. 

Video 3- Storing Infomation to Local Stoage- 
this was a good video. I was able to follow along and understand most of what we were doing and tinkered with it some to try different things. I need to read up more on JSON. We used JSON to put our array values into strings and then save to local stoage and then pull back out to keep our list
